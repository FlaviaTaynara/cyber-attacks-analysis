4248,"UAC0063 hacking group targeted embassies in European and Central Asian countries beginning on June 20, 2022","Bitdefender Labs has identified an ongoing cyber-espionage campaign orchestrated by the threat actor UAC-0063 targeting organizations in Central Asia and Europe. Initially focused on government institutions in Central Asia, the group has expanded its operations to include embassies in Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, Romania, and Georgia, aiming to exfiltrate sensitive data from high-value targets. 
The attackers gained initial access by weaponizing stolen Microsoft Word documents from previously compromised victims, exemplifying a supply chain attack strategy. These malicious documents deployrf the HATVIBE loader and other malware, including DownEx, DownExPyer (also known as CHERRYSPY), and PyPlunderPlug, a USB-based data exfiltrator. To evade detection, the attackers delivered the weaponized documents via phishing emails that contain download links rather than direct attachments. Upon opening the documents, users encountered blurred pages and misleading warnings urging them to enable macros, which triggered malware execution.
CERT-UA has assessed with moderate confidence that UAC-0063 is linked to the Russian cyber-espionage group APT28 (BlueDelta). Still, no definitive technical evidence existed to confirm this connection for Bitdefender Labs. 
In September and October 2024, multiple alerts detected weaponized documents uploaded from Kazakhstan likely exfiltrated from Kazakh embassies based on metadata. On November 21, 2024, the latest attack attempt involved a malicious document hosted on a compromised server, which was sent via phishing emails. On April 4, 2024, a newly compiled version of DownExPyer was deployed against a target in Romania, while on January 12, 2023, the PyPlunderPlug USB exfiltration tool was found on a compromised system in Germany.",2022-06-20,2024-11-21,"Attack on (inter alia) political target(s), not politicized",,Incident disclosed by IT-security company,Data theft,Not available - Not available - Not available - Not available - Not available - Not available - Not available,Netherlands; Germany; Kazakhstan; Afghanistan; Georgia; Romania; United Kingdom,EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); WESTEU - EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); WESTEU - ASIA; CSTO; SCO - ASIA; SASIA - ASIA; CENTAS - EUROPE; BALKANS; NATO; EU(MS) - EUROPE; NATO; NORTHEU,State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system,"Other (e.g., embassies) - Other (e.g., embassies) - Other (e.g., embassies) - Other (e.g., embassies) - Other (e.g., embassies) - Other (e.g., embassies) - Other (e.g., embassies)",UAC-0063,Not available,Unknown - not attributed,,1,25133,2025-01-29 00:00:00,"Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF)",IT-security community attributes attacker,Bitdefender,Bitdefender,Romania,UAC-0063,Not available,Unknown - not attributed,https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia,International power,International power,"EU, USA et. al –  Russia",Yes / HIIK intensity,HIIK 2,0,,Not available,,Not available,Not available,,,,,,FALSE,,,,,,0,,,Not available,0,,,,0,,0,,0,euro,,,,,0,,,,,,Not available,,,,https://www.romania-insider.com/bitdefender-russian-hacking-targeting-romanian-institutions-jan-2025; https://www.bitdefender.com/en-us/blog/businessinsights/uac-0063-cyber-espionage-operation-expanding-from-central-asia,2025-01-30,2025-02-06,Open

4130,Unknown Threat Actors Stole Credentials of Employees of 30 Companies Across 12 Industries Worldwide Beginning in Early July 2024,"Beginning in at least July 2024, unknown threat actors launched a sophisticated global phishing campaign targeting employees of 30 companies across 12 industries, distributing over 200 malicious links designed to steal user login credentials, with stolen credentials sent to attackers in real time via C2 servers or Telegram bots. Cybersecurity researchers at Group-IB reported on 11 December 2024. 
The industries targeted in this phishing operation included Energy, Fashion, Finance, Aerospace, Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Government, IT, Healthcare, Technology, and Entertainment. 
This campaign was designed to bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) and evade detection. In particular, the attackers used three main techniques to bypass email security: Trusted Domain Abuse, Dynamic Company Branding, Document Platform Impersonation. In the trusted domain abuse tactic, attackers embedded malicious URLs within legitimate services like Adobe.com and Google AMP, making it harder for security tools to detect.

3989,"The Italian Private Investigation Company Equalize Gained Access to the Databases of the Italian Law Enforcement Agencies, the Italian Revenue Agency, and the Bank of Italy and Stole Data Beginning in 2019","The Italian private investigation company Equalize gained access to the databases of the Italian law enforcement agencies, the Italian Revenue Agency, and the Bank of Italy and stole data beginning in 2019, reported the Milanese public prosecutor, Francesco de Tommasi, in the course of the investigation's disclosure on 25 October 2024.
The Milan, Bari and Perugia public prosecutor's offices were involved in the investigation. They brought charges against around 60 people for membership in a criminal organisation to abuse access to a computer system, corruption, disclosure of official secrets, abusive wiretapping and aiding and abetting.
The focus is on the private investigation company Equalize and its circle, which is said to have consisted of hackers, computer consultants, private intelligence agencies and police officers. The managing director of Equalize and former police officer Carmine Gallo; the chairman of the Fondazione Fiera Milano, Enrico Pazzali; Gallo's business partner, Nunzio Samuele Calamucci; and the owners or members of associated companies, Massimiliano Camponoro and Giulio Cornelli, were placed under house arrest. Carmine Gallo was wiretapped for having contacts with the mafia and for having 800,000 entries of the database of the Italian law enforcement agencies, SDI. 
The stolen data was primarily intended to be used to harm competitors or political opponents of Pazzali or people associated with him. Furthermore, the stolen data was sold to clients with the same interest, including large companies and professional and law firms.

3986,Unknown Threat Actors Breached French Telecom Free’s Data Management Systems in October 2024,"Unknown threat actors infiltrated the management tools of French telecom provider Free, accessing personal data associated with certain subscriber accounts. While Free reported that no passwords, bank card details, or communications content were compromised, the precise scope and timing of the breach remain undisclosed. In response, Free has lodged a criminal complaint and alerted the National Commission for Information Technology and Civil Liberties (CNIL) and the National Agency for the Security of Information Systems (ANSSI).
On October 21, 2024, an unnamed user on BreachForums put the stolen data from Free up for sale. Although no bank card details were released, over 5 million International Bank Account Numbers (IBANs) were allegedly stolen as part of the attack, with the hackers releasing a sample (100,000) of these numbers on BreachForums.
The Paris judicial court has ordered Telegram to reveal the identity of a hacker behind a ransomware attack on October 31. Free and Free Mobile reported that a cybercriminal identified as ""[Z] [L]"" sent three messages on October 21 through their internal platform for personal data protection, followed by a fourth message addressed to the ""president of the Iliad group,"" Xavier Niel, via Telegram. The hacker demanded a ransom of €10 million in cryptocurrencies. Telegram has been given 48 hours to provide identifying information, such as IP addresses, the phone number used to create the account, and civil identity details.
On 6 December 2024, cybersecurity researcher Clément Domingo (also known as SaxX on X) uncovered that an internal agent likely provided their OpenVPN credentials to a third party, potentially the hacker. That way, the hacker leveraged stolen VPN credentials to infiltrate Free's secure network. Masquerading as IT personnel, the attacker manipulated other employees through social engineering to gain additional credentials, enabling the hacker to access vast customer data. This leak is said to have been known among certain employees, but none of them dared to disclose it to their superiors.",2024-10-21,2024-10-21,Attack on critical infrastructure target(s),,Incident disclosed by victim,Data theft;

3957,"LulzSec Black Attempted to Breach Multiple Targets in Cyprus, Including Government Services and Private Companies, Using a Cyberattack Between 17 and 21 October 2024","Between 17 and 21 October 2024, LulzSec Black, a hacking group, allegedly carried out six cyberattacks targeting government services and private companies in Cyprus, including the government’s main website, the Electricity Authority of Cyprus, Bank of Cyprus, telecommunication company Cyta, oil company EKO, and Hermes Airports, with the initial attempt on Hermes Airports' website being averted on 17 October, according to communications director Maria Kouroupi. The attacks were reportedly politically motivated, citing Cyprus' relationship with Israel as a factor. The cybersecurity firm Odyssey had warned of the imminent attack earlier in the week, stating that the group 'Moroccan Soldiers' had expressed their support for LulzSec Black in these operations. The targeted systems would have included Cypriot infrastructure, specifically government, financial, and critical services, which may have been at risk of service disruptions, data theft, or system compromises. The attacks caused disruptions at Larnaca airport, with long queues forming, while Paphos airport was less affected. The government’s main website was offline for a few minutes on Sunday, but was restored. Authorities, including police spokesman Christos Andreou and Deputy Minister Research Nicodemos Damianou, reported that the situation has normalised, and upgrades to control systems are being carried out. The Commissioner of Communications and head of the Digital Security Authority George Michaelides did not confirm whether there had been attempts to steal data and said the hackers’ motives and targets were not yet discussed. Cybersecurity experts, including Eleftherios Antoniades, Dinos Pastos, and Yianna Danidou, believe the attacks were a 'show of force' and a possible precursor to more significant attacks in the future, highlighting the need for improved cybersecurity measures in Cyprus.",2024-10-17,2024-10-20,"Attack conducted by non-state group / non-state actor with political goals (religious, ethnic, etc. groups) / undefined actor with political goals; Attack on (inter alia) political target(s), politicized; Attack on critical infrastructure target(s)",; ; ,Incident disclosed by attacker,Disruption,Not available - Not available - Not available - Not available - Not available - Not available,Cyprus; Cyprus; Cyprus; Cyprus; Cyprus; Cyprus,EUROPE; EU(MS); MEA - EUROPE; EU(MS); MEA - EUROPE; EU(MS); MEA - EUROPE; EU(MS); MEA - EUROPE; EU(MS); MEA - EUROPE; EU(MS); MEA,Critical infrastructure - State institutions / political system - Critical infrastructure - Critical infrastructure - Critical infrastructure - Critical infrastructure,Energy - Government / ministries - Telecommunications - Transportation - Energy - Finance,Not available,Not available,Non-state-group,Hacktivist(s),1,25183,2024-10-17 00:00:00,"Direct statement in media report (e.g., Reuters article cites the attribution statements by a person) / self-attribution via social media",Attacker confirms,LulzSec Black,Not available,Cyprus,Not available,Not available,Non-state-group,https://therecord.media/cyprus-critical-infrastructure-cyberattack-israel-palestine,Unknown,Unknown,,Unknown,,1,2024-10-18 00:00:00,State Actors: Stabilizing measures,Subnational executive official,Cyprus,Digital Security Authority (Cyprus) ,Not available,,Not available,Not available,Not available,TRUE,Not available,Short-term disruption (< 24h; incident scores 1 point in intensity),Not available,none,none,1,Moderate - high political importance,1,Low,7,Days (< 7 days),No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,1-10,6,1-10,1,,0,euro,None/Negligent,Air law; International telecommunication law; Due diligence; Sovereignty,; ; ; ,Not available,1,2024-10-18 00:00:00,"Other legal measures on national level (e.g. law enforcement investigations, arrests)",,Cyprus,Not available,Not available,,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),,https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/10/18/hermes-airports-averts-cyberattack-on-website-airports-not-affected/; https://www.halkinsesikibris.com/guney-den-haberler/larnaka-havalimani-sitesine-siber-saldiri-h229316.html; https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/10/21/calm-returns-to-airports-after-cyberattacks-overcome/; https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/10/20/cyta-and-eko-also-a-target-of-cyberattacks/; https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/10/20/cyprus-government-portal-also-targetted-in-cyberattack/; https://www.halkinsesikibris.com/guney-den-haberler/guney-de-kritik-yerlerin-alt-yapilari-siber-saldiri-altinda-h229393.html; https://odysseycs.com/resources/threat-alerts/lulzsec-black-targets-critical-infrastructure-in-cyprus/; https://cyprus-mail.com/2024/10/18/hermes-airports-averts-cyberattack-on-website-airports-not-affected/; https://in-cyprus.philenews.com/local/larnaca-airport-targeted-by-hackers-in-unsuccessful-cyberattack/; https://www.pio.gov.cy/%CE%B1%CE%BD%CE%B1%CE%BA%CE%BF%CE%B9%CE%BD%CF%89%CE%B8%CE%AD%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B1-%CE%AC%CF%81%CE%B8%CF%81%CE%BF.html?id=44584#flat; https://x.com/NationalCsirtCy/status/1847598448972881941; https://therecord.media/cyprus-critical-infrastructure-cyberattack-israel-palestine,2024-10-22,2025-02-02,Coding finished

POLADA indicated that there would be an investigation alongside the police, CERT Polska, the Office for Personal Data Protection, and the Ministry of Sport and Tourism, while simultaneously asking citizens to not spread ""propaganda of a hostile country.""",2024-08-06,2024-08-06,"Attack conducted by non-state group / non-state actor with political goals (religious, ethnic, etc. groups) / undefined actor with political goals; Attack on (inter alia) political target(s), not politicized",,Incident disclosed by attacker,Data theft & Doxing; Hijacking with Misuse,,Poland,EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); EASTEU,State institutions / political system,Civil service / administration,,Russia,Non-state-group,Hacktivist(s),2,23174; 23175,2024-08-06 00:00:00; 2024-08-08 00:00:00,"Direct statement in media report (e.g., Reuters article cites the attribution statements by a person) / self-attribution via social media; Direct statement in media report (e.g., Reuters article cites the attribution statements by a person) / self-attribution via social media",Attacker confirms; Attribution by receiver government / state entity,Beregini; Polish Antidoping Agency (POLADA),Not available; Not available,Ukraine; Poland,,Russia; Not available,"Non-state-group; Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",https://t.me/s/hackberegini?before=2495; https://przegladsportowy.onet.pl/igrzyska-olimpijskie/paryz-2024/rosyjscy-hakerzy-zaatakowali-polske-wykradli-dane-mamy-wiesci-ze-srodka/e9wjqed,System / ideology; Territory; Resources; International power,System/ideology; Territory; Resources; International power; Third-party intervention / third-party affection,Russia – Ukraine; Russia – Ukraine; Russia – Ukraine; Russia – Ukraine; Russia – Ukraine,Yes / HIIK intensity,HIIK 5,0,,Not available,,Not available,Not available,No,,Not available,Data Exfiltration,Not available,FALSE,For private / commercial targets: non-sensitive information (incident scores 1 point in intensity),Not available,"Hijacking, system misuse, e.g., through data theft and / or disruption (incident scores 2 points in intensity)",none,none,3,Moderate - high political importance,3,Low,9,No system interference/disruption,Major data breach/exfiltration (critical/sensitive information) & data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data ,1-10,1,1-10,1,,0,euro,Indirect (knowingly sanctioning / ordering / ideological / material support by official members of state entities/agencies/units for officially non-state-actors),Human rights; Sovereignty,Civic / political rights; ,Not available,0,,"Other legal measures on national level (e.g. law enforcement investigations, arrests)",,Poland,Polish National Police,Not available,,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),,https://www.rosenheim24.de/sport/mix/robert-lewandowski-und-der-polada-hack-name-von-ex-fc-bayern-star-taucht-in-geleakten-daten-auf-93242060.html; https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5700428/2024/08/14/polish-anti-doping-cyber-attack/; https://t.me/s/hackberegini?before=2495; https://przegladsportowy.onet.pl/igrzyska-olimpijskie/paryz-2024/rosyjscy-hakerzy-zaatakowali-polske-wykradli-dane-mamy-wiesci-ze-srodka/e9wjqed; https://therecord.media/polish-anti-doping-agency-polada-hack-leak; https://research.checkpoint.com/2024/19th-august-threat-intelligence-report/; https://www.politico.eu/article/poland-russia-cyber-war-belarus-gawkowski-anti-doping-agency/; https://www.latribune.fr/economie/international/pologne-un-groupe-de-hackers-russo-belarusse-demantele-1005975.html; https://www.scmagazine.com/brief/russia-belarus-linked-cyber-operation-disrupted-by-poland; https://kyivindependent.com/belarus-weekly-poland-uncovers-a-cyber-sabotage-group-linked-to-russian-belarusian-security-services/,2024-08-15,2024-11-14,Coding finished

The attack began around 19:30 CEST, causing the cancellation of four flights and delays for 77 others. Manual processing was required to continue operations, resulting in prolonged delays.
Airport officials confirmed the ransomware attack by the Akira gang and ruled out negotiations with the group. The airport's IT system remains under repair, with experts working intensively to restore full functionality.

3498,"Unknown Cybercriminals Encrypt Systems of Dutch communications company AddComm in Ransomware Attack Beginning on 5 May 2024, stealing data from Dutch Bank ABN AMRO and regional tax authority","Unknown threat actors launched a ransomware attack on the Dutch customer communications company AddComm, a supplier for ABN AMRO, as disclosed by the Dutch bank on 24 May 2024. The attack occurred between 5 May and 17 May 2024, with the security incident becoming firstly known to AddComm on 17 May 2024, when the systems were encrypted by the cybercriminals. The encryption of AddComm's systems and data, caused their systems to be unavailable to customers in recent days. The attackers potentially accessed data of a limited number of ABN AMRO clients. While no evidence currently suggests misuse of the compromised data, ABN AMRO is taking precautionary measures.
The attack did not affect ABN AMRO’s own systems, and the compromised data does not include sensitive information such as passwords or credentials that could be used for financial transactions. ABN AMRO has reported the incident to the Dutch Data Protection Authority and other regulatory bodies. 
By late May, reporting also indicated that the Regional Belasting Groep, also a Dutch regional governmental office responsible for municipal taxes and a client of AddComm, had data stolen through the ransomware attack between 5 and 17 May 2024. According to the RBG, the hackers gained access to its data through AddComm, which RBG uses to send out its tax assessments.
RBG stated that an investigation was underway, while regional media reported on 25 May that some data from the group was already being leaked. A further update on 4 June 2024 confirmed that personal data of some residents within the RBG's jurisdiction (Schiedam, Vlaardingen and Delft) had been stolen, including addresses, social security numbers, and bank account information.

3487,The Ransomware Group Lockbit Carried Out A Ransomware Attack Against The Italian University of Siena Beginning On 7 May 2024,"The Italian University of Siena, in Tuscany, has been facing a cyberattack carried out by the ransomware group LockBit since the 7th of May. The attackers claim to have exfiltrated 514 GB of sensitive data, including financial data and internal documents, and have set a ransom deadline of 28 May. The intrusion has caused disruption to university operations and forced the suspension of several services, such as international admissions, ticketing and payment management platforms. The stolen data reportedly includes detailed financial plans, project funding documents and non-disclosure agreements for upcoming events, highlighting the extent of the compromised data. The university is working with the Italian National Agency for Cybersecurity to mitigate the impact, although official confirmation of LockBit's involvement is still pending. In a public statement, the University of Siena confirmed the attack and the resulting service disruptions.

3388,"Chinese State-Affiliated Hacker Group Presumably Compromised 19,000 Confidential Files Of German Manufacturing Company Volkswagen Between 2010 And 2015","According to research by German public-service television broadcaster 'ZDF' and German news outlet 'Spiegel', Volkswagen AG was targeted in a cyber attack orchestrated by suspected Chinese state hackers between 2010 and 2015. During this timeframe, several attacks occurred, affecting not only Volkswagen but also its subsidiaries Audi and Bentley. It is estimated that approximately 19,000 confidential files were potentially stolen during these attacks. These files primarily contained information on drive technologies such as petrol engines, transmissions, and dual clutches, as well as future-oriented fields like electromobility and fuel cells.
Volkswagen confirmed the information regarding the cyber attacks but refrained from commenting on the attribution of the perpetrators. According to the research, the IP addresses associated with the hackers pointed to the Chinese military. Moreover, the utilization of espionage software such as ""PlugX"" and ""China Chopper"" further suggests the involvement of Chinese state hackers.
Volkswagen reportedly became aware of the attack on 3 June 2014, and responded by shutting down large parts of its network on 24 April 2015.

This attack, which was carried out via a criminal online platform, flooded the server with requests, making the police website temporarily inaccessible. Despite the thirty-minute interruption, no sensitive data of individuals or organisations was at risk. 
Following an in-depth investigation led by the Dresden Public Prosecutor General's Office, the Cybercrime Competence Centre of the Saxony State Criminal Police Office successfully shut down a criminal online platform operating in Germany and abroad on 17 April 2024 as part of the international Operation ""PowerOFF"" in cooperation with a US law enforcement agency. The IT infrastructure used by the perpetrators to carry out DDoS attacks was thus dismantled.
The online platform enabled users to buy DDoS attacks with cryptocurrencies, which led to the disruption of various online services, including the Saxony police website.

An additional 49 government agencies were reported as targeted. Confirmed victims include entities in Mexico, Brazil, Guyana, Paraguay, the United Kingdom, Hungary, Egypt, Jordan, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines and the Republic of Korea. The threat actor leverages access to government infrastructure to target other government entities, abusing the infrastructure to host malicious payloads, proxy attack traffic, and send spear-phishing emails to government-related targets using compromised government email accounts. Earth Krahang was further observed as setting up VPN connections from compromised public-facing servers to develop access into private victim networks and as performing brute-force attacks to obtain email credentials. These credentials are then used to exfiltrate victim emails.

3258,Anonymous Sudan claimed responsibility for suspected DDoS attack against Interministerial Digital Directorate of France affecting governmental institutions on 10 March 2024,"The self-styled hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan claimed responsibility for a DDoS attack directed against the Interministerial Digital Directorate of France (DINUM) on 10 March 2024. DINUM provides the backbone for digital projects of a range of governmental institutions across France. Anonymous Sudan, whose past activities have exhibited pro-Russian patterns, declared on Telegram that 17,000 IP addresses and over 300 domains were linked to DINUM services and potentially subject to access disruptions. The group claimed specifically to have targeted the websites of the Ministries of the Economy, Culture, Ecological Transition, and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGAC). The Prime Minister's Office broadly noted that a number of government bodies were affected. The precise extent, including whether the DDoS attack affected non-public resources, has not been officially confirmed. To coordinate mitigation measures and restore the availability of IT services, the authorities set up a crisis cell. Access to most government sites was restored by the afternoon of 11 March.
A news article by French outlet Le Point from 16 March cited an unnamed ANSSI expert who qualified the official executive statements that the incident has been ""unprecedented"" as exaggerated. The article also made the point that the executive branch thereby gave the attackers what they wanted, which is public attention.

3242,Ransomware gang Medusa claimed responsibility for disruption of IT environment of Swedish hospital Sophiahemmet on 26 February 2024,"The hospital Sophiahemmet in Stockholm suffered a ransomware attack on 26 February 2024.

Following the reception of the note, the hospital disconnected all computers from its network. Due to these response measures, the hospital was forced to close its emergency service for a day. The hospital said that the incident had no impact on  patient care at the hospital. 
On 9 February - two days before the attack was discovered - , newly emerged ransomware group Blackout published on their blog in the dark web that they had encrypted over 100 servers and stolen a database of 900,000+ patients with their addresses, phone numbers, medical history. The self-attribution is confirmed by cybersecurity experts such as Damien Bancal and Clément Domingo. As the countdown for paying the ransom expired Blackout published the stolen data on their website on 25 February 2024. According to a press statement of the hospital on 28 February 2024, the amount of data stolen is considerably smaller, including information of 300,000 patients, mainly based on lists with contact details, date of arrival and area of care.

3124,"Chinese state-sponsored threat actor infiltrated 20,000 FortiGate appliances and infiltrated network of Dutch Ministry of Defence, stealing user data in 2022-2023","A Chinese state-sponsored threat actor infiltrated a network within the Ministry of Defence in 2023, the Dutch Military Intelligence and Security Service (MIVD) and the civilian General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) assessed with high confidence in an advisory released on 6 February 2024. 
The network was set up for research and development (R&D) activities related to unclassified projects, facilitating collaboration with two external research institutes. The intrusion group utilised a vulnerability found in FortiGate devices (CVE-2022-42475) to install the previously undocumented COATHANGER malware on infected devices and gain access to communications between the infected devices. Upon developing access to the network, the threat actors conducted reconnaissance and stole user account data. According to MIVD and AIVD findings, harvested information appeared limited in scope, as the compromised network was segregated from wider Ministry of Defence infrastructure and only had a maximum of 50 users. MIVD reporting on the incident marks the first instance of the agency publishing a technical report on the methods of Chinese threat actors. The Dutch intelligence services noted that the implant had previously been detected on the networks of a Western diplomatic mission, in addition to several other unnamed victims. In a statement responding to the report, the Chinese embassy in the Netherlands asserted the Chinese government would ""not allow any country or individual using Chinese infrastructure to engage in such illegal activities"". 
Further reporting in June 2024 by the MIVD indicated that more victims were affected than previously thought: up to 20,000 FortiGate VPN appliances, including those serving ""dozens of Western governments, international organisations, and numerous companies operating in the defence industry,"" were hacked between 2022 and 2023 in order to carry out what was described in the report as an ""ongoing state-sponsored cyber espionage campaign."" According to the MIVD's report, the Chinese hacker(s) knew about the vulnerability at least two months prior to its disclosure and were able to hack into at least 14,000 devices during this zero-day period. If a victim was deemed by the hackers to be ""relevant,"" malware was installed on the system, giving the hackers persistent access even if updates were downloaded to the FortiGate appliances.",2022-01-01,Not available,"Attack conducted by non-state group / non-state actor with political goals (religious, ethnic, etc. groups) / undefined actor with political goals;

3108,Unknown hackers stole data from French health insurance third-party payment service Viamedis in late Janaury 2024,"On 29 January 2024, the French third-party payment service Viamedis became the target of an intrusion leading to the theft of customer data. One of the four shareholders in Viamedis, issued a statement to its customers on the evening of 31 January on the incident. Viamedis operates as a payment service for about 84 complementary health services, including Carte Blanche Partenaires, Itelis, Kalixia and Santéclair, which in total service about 20 million customers. The precise number of affected customers had not yet been determined at the time of reporting. The stolen data included information about the civil status, date of birth, social security number and name of insurance provider. Viamedis says that the compromised platform has been disconnected in response to the incident, potentially limiting access for certain healthcare businesses, in particular opticians and hearing aid specialists.  However, the company says that most people should be able to use their carte Vitale and third-party payment card as normal.  As of 6 February, Viamedis' website remained inaccessible. The company filled a complaint and informed the French data protection authority and cybersecurity agency about the incident.

3106,"Unknown Hacker Disrupted Three Hospitals in District of Soest, Germany encrypted and stole data, on 2 February 2024","On 2 February 2024, the IT infrastructure of three hospitals in the district of Soest, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, was targeted by a network disruption. Affected hospitals included the Dreifaltigkeits-Hospital in Lippstadt, the Marien-Hospital in Erwitte and the Hospital zum Heiligen Geist in Geseke, all of which are connected via a shared network with the Dreifaltigkeits-Hospital in Lippstadt as the central node.
This incident led to operational limitations, as the hospitals were unable to admit new patients or carry out planned operations. Emergency services remained in place.

3038,Russian Ransomware Group Medusa Suspected of Compromising Belgian Waste Management Organisation Limburg.Net on 13 December 2023,"On 13 December 2023, Limburg.net, the inter-municipal organisation for waste prevention and collection in the province of Limburg and the city of Diest in Belgium, became the subject of an intrusion through which data from over 300,000 Belgian households was compromised. In response to the breach, all systems were immediately shut down to prevent further damage. The organisation's website remained offline for several days. 
Subsequent investigations revealed that threat actors of suspected Russian origin had infiltrated an old data server and copied documents containing public or outdated data, with media reports linking the activity to the ransomware group Medusa. The compromised data mainly dates back to before the merger of three municipalities in 2005 and contained personal data such as names, addresses and national register numbers of 311,000 heads of household from several municipalities in 2014 and 2015. These contents match with leaked data. Limburg.net rejected the hackers' ransom demand of $100,000 and reported the incident to the police.

3033,Unspecified Subgroup Of Iranian APT Mint Sandstorm (Also Known As APT35 / Charming Kitten) conducted Espionage Campaign Against International High-Level Targets In Academia Since At Least November 2023,"An unspecified subset of Mint Sandstorm (formerly tracked as PHOSPHORUS), an Iran-based subgroup of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), has been actively conducting a campaign since November 2023, which specifically targeted high-level individuals involved in Middle Eastern affairs at universities and research institutions in Belgium, France, Gaza, Israel, the United Kingdom and the United States. The group used advanced social engineering techniques, customised phishing lures and new post-exploitation techniques, including the use of a special backdoor called MediaPl, according to Microsoft.
Impersonating a journalist and a news outlet alongside other high-profile researchers through spoofed and compromised email accounts, the threat actor attempted to develop trust with their targets before delivering malicious content. The goals of the campaign appear to be centred on gathering information about the war between Israel and Hamas, with a focus on individuals in contact with or in a position to influence members of intelligence and policy communities. It is not yet known exactly which institution has been compromised.

3028,External Provider of Spanish Employment Agency Lanbide Fell Victim to Blackcat Ransomware Attack Starting in 2021 ,"Two servers of an external service provider of the federal Basque employment agency Lanbide in Spain were infected with the Blackcat ransomware in 2021, according to an announcement by the employment agency on 17 January 2024. The ransomware was discovered on the subcontractor's servers in November 2023. At the time of the attack in 2021, the servers were no longer actively in use and have not been used since, which is why the incident was only discovered two years later. Lanbide explained that the attackers obtained personal customer data such as identity and contact information. The data belonged to a survey Lanbide conducted for the years 2017 to 2021, as well as job applicants during the same time period. Lanbide stated that the stolen data has not been made public yet.

Throughout the campaign, the group used documents as lure that predominately feature the Israel-Hamas war to deliver the backdoor, which is exclusively used by ITG05. X-Force said that the campaign was highly targeted since ITG05’s infrastructure ensures ""only targets from a single specific country can receive the malware"". 
Targeted countries were Hungary, Türkiye, Australia, Poland, Belgium, Ukraine, Germany, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, Kazakhstan, Italy, Latvia and Romania. X-Force further noted that all but one of them are United Nations Human Rights Council members.

2878,Polish train manufacturer Newag SA suspected of installing programming errors in its own trains since 2022,"On 5 December 2023, a trio of Polish security researchers (part of Dragon Sector, a Polish pentesting team) that were hired in May 2022 by Serwis Pojazdów Szynowych (SPS), an independent train maintenance firm, claimed that trains manufactured by Polish Newag SA have embedded software that disables them when their hardware is serviced by competitors. More specifically, the research collective found out that train systems locked up for no apparent reason after being serviced in third-party workshops. Dragon Sector speculated that Newag engineers introduced the code responsible for the malfunctions to ensure maintenance contracts would be awarded to Newag, in light of the apparent failure of competitors to complete the task. Prior to commissioning Dragon Sector for the review of the train systems, SPS had accrued 2 million złoty (€462,000) in fines for delays in fulfilling its contractual maintenance obligations.
Newag denied those allegations on the day following the presentation of these findings, stating that the technical issues are the result of the work of unknown hackers and threatened to file a lawsuit against Dragon Sector.
Janusz Cieszyński, Poland’s former minister of digital affairs, communicated on 6 December that Newag assured to him of no wrongdoing, but said that the report he saw indicated otherwise.

2842,Chinese hacker group Chimera accessed IT system of Dutch semiconductor manufacturer NXP during 2017-2020,"The Chinese hacker group Chimera compromised user accounts of the Dutch semiconductor manufacturer NXP between 2017 and 2020, gaining access to the company's IT system and collecting information about the company's chip design and other intangible assets. 
According to the Dutch newspaper NRC, the threat actor used accounts belonging to NXP employees to log into the company's internal network. They obtained the necessary access data from previous data leaks in social networks such as LinkedIn. From the first infiltrated account, the members of the cyber gang are believed to have gradually expanded their access rights to cover their tracks and sneak into other supposedly secure parts of the networks. According to NRC, Chimera encrypted sensitive data identified by the group with ransomware and transferred it to cloud storage services such as Microsoft OneDrive, Google Drive and Dropbox. Log files show that the cybercriminals returned in intervals of several weeks to access new data and take control over additional user accounts. 
In January 2020, NXP was informed about the intrusion by Transavia, a Dutch airline company that had been attacked by Chinese hackers in September 2019. The investigation into the breach at Transavia facilitated the detection of the NXP compromise.

These functions have been executed to match the group's objectives, ensuring constant control and directives across a variety of targets.
According to Check Point, Gamaredon is still targeting a range of Ukrainian objectives. However, due to the USB worm's characteristics, indications of a potential infection have been detected in various countries, including the United States of America, Vietnam, Chile, Poland and Germany.

The group posted a link to a website status monitoring service together with screenshot of what appeared to be timed-out request for loading the website of the Chamber of Representative, Belgium's lower house of parliament. The Centre for Cyber Security (CCB) confirmed that several government websites were targeted for disruption.

According to a company statement, they were able to thwart the attack in an early stage. However, card payments were not possible over the subsequent weekend due to the attack. Whether data had been stolen remained unclear at the time of the reporting. The Berlin Police said that the attackers tried to blackmail the KaDeWe. German parliament member Misbah Khan from the party Bündnis 90/Die Grünen issued a statement via media calling for increased awareness about cyber security as a part of national security in Germany.
One day after the disclosure, the ransomware group posted alleged KaDeWe data on their leak site, including customer and employee data, Supervisory Board minutes, data from the company's finance department and information on a number of the KaDeWe Group's business partners.
In contrast to initial statements by the head of KaDeWe, who downplayed the impact of the incident and also the amount and severity of stolen data, the final report of the Berlin Commissioner for Data Protection and Freedom of Information stated that data of 850 employees and around 4300 customers were stolen by the attackers.

The hacker advertised the information for sale on the underground market place Breach Forums on 11 October 2023, after Shadow PC had not responded to extortion demands. On the same day, Shadow PC reportedly sent out data breach notifications to affected customers. This notification, as confirmed by customers to Bleeping Computer, traced the intrusion of Shadow PC to an employee, who was tricked into downloading an information stealer from Discord at the end of September 2023. The hacker leveraged this access to steal an authentication cookie, which in turn was used to gain access to the management interface of a Shadow PC software-as-a-service provider.

The city websites of Hannover, Dresden, Nuremberg, Cologne, and Dortmund all found themselves victims of DDoS attacks, causing service disruptions but no data theft.
In Hannover, the city website and its partner portals experienced service interruptions and increased unreliability, restricting access to services for citizens. Nevertheless, the experts from the data centres and the website development team managed to decipher the attack pattern and restore stable operations at around 2 pm local time. Nuremberg, Cologne, and Dortmund also saw the restriction of city services with the shutdown of the cities' websites, and all had access similarly restored within a number of hours thanks to work done by city IT departments.
In Dresden, while Prof. Dr. Michael Breidung, head of the IT department of the city, claimed success in fending off the attack, the attack, like in the other cities, resulted in ""severe restrictions of access"" to the city's homepage for hours, restricting citizens' access to certain services, and the website was ultimately taken offline as a precaution to prevent further damage.

2661,North Korean state-sponsored hacking group 'Lazarus' gained access to network of unspecified Spanish aerospace company beginning in 2022,"The North Korean state-sponsored hacking group 'Lazarus' gained access to the network of an unspecified Spanish aerospace company beginning in 2022, the Slovakian IT security firm ESET assessed with high confidence in a technical report released on 29 September 2023.
The APT group posed as a recruiter for the technology company Meta and tricked an employee of the Spanish aerospace company into opening two malicious files on their corporate computer, which were disguised as programming tasks that the employee wanted to solve as part of the job application.

2618,Unknown government infected mobile phone of Russian journalist Galina Timchenko with Pegasus spyware on 10 February 2023,"An unknown government infected the mobile phone of Russian journalist Galina Timchenko on 10 February 2023 with the Pegasus spyware, the non-profit organisation Access Now and the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab reported on 13 September 2023.
According to the report, Russian journalist Galina Timchenko received a notification from Apple on 22 June 2023, alerting her that state-sponsored hackers may have been targeting her iPHone. When she contacted Access Now, they, in cooperation with Citizen Lab, found out that her mobile phone had been infected on 10 February 2023 and that this probably lasted for several days or weeks. At the time, she was in Berlin at a private Redkollegia meeting with other Russian journalists in exile to discuss the legal risks of the ""undesirable"" and ""foreign agent"" designations. The infection took place not only after the Russian government declared the independent news website Meduza, run by Timchenko, undesirable two weeks earlier, but also amid discussion by European politicians to monitor Russian exiles.
The report by Access Now and Citizen Lab assumes with a high degree of probability that the attacker must be a government, as the Pegasus spy software is only sold to governments but have not conclusively identified the government responsible. The technical report discussed several possibilities, noting that there's currently no publicly evidence of the Russian government using Pegasus.",2023-02-10,Not available,"Attack conducted by nation state (generic “state-attribution” or direct attribution towards specific state-entities, e.g., intelligence agencies); Attack on non-political target(s), politicized",,"Incident disclosed by third-party-actor (e.g., Citizen Lab, Amnesty International, whistleblowers) or authorities of another state",Hijacking without Misuse,"Galina Timchenko (Executive Editor and Owner of Meduza, Russia)",Latvia,EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); NORTHEU,Media,,Unknown,Not available,State,,1,14035; 14035; 14035; 14035,2023-09-13 00:00:00; 2023-09-13 00:00:00; 2023-09-13 00:00:00; 2023-09-13 00:00:00,"Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF); Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF); Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF); Technical report (e.g., by IT-companies, Citizen Lab, EFF)",Attribution by third-party; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by third-party,CitizenLab; CitizenLab; Access Now; Access Now,Not available; Not available; Not available; Not available,Global (region); Canada; Global (region); Canada,Unknown; Unknown; Unknown; Unknown,Not available; Not available; Not available; Not available,State; State; State; State,https://www.accessnow.org/publication/hacking-meduza-pegasus-spyware-used-to-target-putins-critic/,Unknown,Unknown,,Unknown,,0,,Not available,,Not available,Not available,Yes,One,Drive-By Compromise,Not available,,FALSE,Not available,Not available,"Hijacking, not used - empowerment (incident scores 1 point in intensity)",none,none,1,Moderate - high political importance,1,Minor,5,No system interference/disruption,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,1-10,1,1-10,1,,0,euro,Direct (official members of state entities / agencies / units responsible),Human rights; Armed conflict; Armed conflict,Civic / political rights; Conduct of hostilities; Certain persons,Not available,0,,Not available,,Not available,Not available,Human rights; Armed conflict,,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/sep/13/exiled-russian-journalist-galina-timchenko-reportedly-hacked-using-nso-group-spyware; https://twitter.com/SophieintVeld/status/1701953607111778607; https://www.accessnow.org/publication/hacking-meduza-pegasus-spyware-used-to-target-putins-critic/; https://therecord.media/meduza-ceo-hacked-pegasus-spyware-russian-journalist; https://netzpolitik.org/2023/meduza-russische-exil-journalistin-mit-pegasus-gehackt/; https://securityaffairs.com/150816/intelligence/russian-journalists-iphone-pegasus-spyware.html; https://www.heise.de/news/Pegasus-iPhone-russischer-Journalisten-in-Deutschland-mit-Spyware-infiziert-9304862.html?wt_mc=rss.red.ho.ho.rdf.beitrag.beitrag; https://therecord.media/more-russians-investigating-spyware; https://www.darkreading.com/mobile/nation-state-actor-used-0-click-exploit-to-drop-pegasus-spyware-on-russian-journalist-s-iphone; https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-09-14/ty-article/.premium/report-phones-of-russian-journalists-including-israeli-citizen-hacked-with-spyware/0000018a-94f8-d05a-abfe-fcfca92e0000; https://www.politico.eu/article/eu-should-ban-spyware-russian-exiled-journalist-says/; https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/28/critics-of-serbias-government-targeted-with-military-grade-spyware; https://securityaffairs.com/157667/malware/ishutdown-spyware-infections-iphones.html; https://therecord.media/nso-group-spyware-company-ordered-code-whatsapp; https://netzpolitik.org/2024/klage-gegen-nso-group-staatstrojaner-firma-soll-quellcode-von-pegasus-uebergeben/; https://securityaffairs.com/159847/security/nso-group-vs-meta-pegasus-hand-over.html; https://therecord.media/apple-spyware-notifications-92-countries; https://www.wired.com/story/apple-iphone-spyware-101/,2023-09-15,2024-05-07,Coding finished

The group claims to be of Dutch origin, however, experts assume that is maintains connections to Russia. Local police and firefighters were forced to switch communications to analogue means.
Local authorities, in collaboration with specialists from Telefónica, have set up a special task force to assess the extent of the attack and the damage it caused. The incident has been reported to the National Center for Cryptology (CCN-CERT) for further analysis and guidance. Based on a preliminary review, a city official noted no indications that data had been exfiltrated. After issuing an initial ransomware demand of €5 million, Lockbit dropped these figures first to €1.5 million and eventually €1 million. 
In September 2024 it was reported that the City of Seville has tendered a contract of 1,554,649.71 euros (without taxes) for an external service to carry out audits and strengthen its computer security, as a direct response to the incident.",2023-09-05,Not available,"Attack on (inter alia) political target(s), not politicized",,Incident disclosed by authorities of victim state,Disruption;

2579,Tools of cybercriminal group 'W3LL' leveraged to compromise corporate Microsoft 365 accounts in phishing operation beginning In October 2022,"Group-IB researchers have linked together a string of phishing campaigns against corporate Microsoft 365 accounts going back to 2017 to tools of a largely undocumented threat actor that the company tracks under the name of 'W3LL'.
One of the instruments, the W3LL Panel phishing kit, designed to bypass multi-factor authentication (MFA) by obtaining an authenticated session cookie that provides access to Microsoft 365 accounts, played a crucial role in this extensive operation, which mainly targeted victims in the US, UK, Australia, and Germany. The kit, alongside several other tools for business email compromise, was offered to a vetted group of at least 500 threat actors through an underground marketplace called W3LL Store, set up specifically for this purpose in 2018. The tools were deployed against at least Microsoft 365 accounts and succeeded in breaking into an estimated 8,000.
Group-IB tied around 850 different phishing websites to W3LL Panel, meticulously customized to different industries and geographic regions. The affected industries, in order of frequency, are: manufacturing & engineering, information technology, consulting, finance and healthcare.",2022-10-01,Not available,"Attack on (inter alia) political target(s), not politicized;

2556,Cybercriminal hacking group Earth Estries compromised networks of governments and technology companies in several countries beginning as early as 2023,"The cybercriminal hacking group Earth Estries compromised networks of governments and technology companies in several countries beginning at the latest in early 2023, Japanese IT security firm Trend Micro assessed in a technical report on 30 August 2023. 
The investigation uncovered the compromise of existing accounts with administrative privileges. At an unnamed organization, these breaches were traced to an internal server. Installing the remote control tool Cobalt Strike on this system enabled the threat actors to load additional malware for lateral movement.

The hackers very likely gained initial access by exploiting the ZeroLogon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472) on web servers or via brute forcing remote desktop protocol (RDP) credentials. CosmicBeetle used the Spacecolon malware, which contained the three Delphi components ScHackTool, ScInstaller and ScService. The presence of Turkish strings suggested a Turkish-speaking developer may have authored the malware.
The targets were located in East and Southeast Asia, Europe, Turkey and Israel, Morocco and Botswana, North and South America. Specifically named were a hospital and a tourist resort in Thailand, an insurance company in Israel, a local government institution in Poland, an entertainment provider in Brazil, an environmental company in Turkey and a school in Mexico.

Ten days after the incident was detected, Azero announced that it was winding down its activities.
According to the notifications, the ransomware group managed to gain access to the critical administrative system, all data storage silos and all backup systems. They encrypted all server disks and data. The ransomware group demanded six Bitcoins in ransom, which is the equivalent of about €146,000.
Consequently, a majority of both CloudNordic and AzeroCloud customers lost their data stored in the respective clouds.

2519,Iranian state-sponsored hacking group 'Charming Kitten' gained access to emails of Iranian expat Dr. Mansour Sohrabi beginning in October 2022,"The Iranian state-sponsored hacking group 'Charming Kitten' gained access to the emails of Iranian expat Dr. Mansour Sohrabi during the period of October 2022 to 6 November 2022, the German Media outlets Tagesschau and Westdeutscher Rundfunk (WDR) reported on 19 August 2023, based on a warning issued by the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV) on 10 August 2023.
According to the report, Dr. Mansour Sohrabi, who received political asylum in Germany in 2015, received a job offer on Instagram from an online persona purporting to be a Kurdish researcher working for the US think tank Atlantic Council. After sharing his phone number with the contact, Sohrabi was approached via WhatsApp and then Telegram by a user claiming to be Hagar Chemali on 6 November 2022. Hagar Chemali is a well-known political satirist in the United States. The user impersonating Hagar Chemali then invited him for a job interview on the same day, to which Sohrabi agreed. He was provided a link to participate in a video call. Upon attempting to join, Sohrabi was redirected to a website controlled by the attackers and requested to enter authentication codes, supposedly to unlock his camera, which likely opened his associated accounts to compromise.
The article by Taggesschau and WDR quoted unspecified experts who assume that the responsible hacker group was Charming Kitten, a state-sponsored group from Iran. Sohrabi speculated he may have been targeted because of his work on environmental crises in Iran.

The reported targets were small and medium-sized businesses and government entities, mainly from Poland, Ecuador, and Italy. ESET stated that the targets were connected by their use of Zimbra. Additionally, affected countries included Russia, Kazakhstan, Ukraine, France, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, and Peru. According to ESET, it seems likely that the attackers were able to compromise the victims' administrator accounts, allowing them to create new email accounts that were then used to send phishing emails to other targets.

2513,'Play' ransomware group comromised Managed Service Providers to gain access to targets from various sectors since June 2022,"The ransomware group 'Play' has compromised Managed Service Providers (MSPs) since June 2022 to gain access to targets from various sectors, such as mid-sized businesses in the finance, legal, software, shipping, law enforcement, and logistics sectors in the US, Australia, UK, Italy, and other countries. According to threat research company Adlumin, the group gained access to privileged management systems and remote monitoring management (RMM) tools and also employed phishing, targeting employees at MSPs. Additional vectors included two known vulnerabilities in Fortinet firewalls (CVE-2018-13379 and CVE-2020-12812). After the group established a foothold in the MSP customer networks, it exploited multiple vulnerabilities, mainly to move laterally through victim networks.

2504,Thousands of public and private US websites compromised to host scammy offers and promotions to children since approximately 2018 ,"Thousands of public and private US websites have been compromised to host scammy offers and promotions to children since approximately 2018, according to security researcher Zach Edwards from HUMAN Security, who presented his findings on the still ongoing activity at Black Hat 2023. Among the hijacked websites are those of US government agencies, leading universities, and professional organizations. The purpose of the scam appears to be to trick children into downloading apps, malware, or submitting personal details. According to Edwards, the described activities can be traced back to one advertising company, named CPABuild, who did not respond to inquiries from technology news outlet Wired. In 2020, Italy’s Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) published an alert about compromised domains, including a reference to Zach Edwards.

2459,North Korean hacking group 'Lazarus' targeted cryptocurrency payments platform CoinsPaid on 22 July 2023,"The North Korean state-backed hacking group 'Lazarus' is suspected of having targeted cryptocurrency payments platform CoinsPaid on 22 July 2023, the company disclosed on 26 July. 
The incident led the platform, which runs a payment system to support businesses in the use of cryptocurrencies, to shut down for four days. Lazarus is assessed to have siphoned off $37.3 million in company assets during the theft, which reportedly did not affect client funds. Incident analysis shared by CoinsPaid identified the intrusion as a hybrid attack combining social engineering, bribery of critical personnel, and intrusion attempts against numerous internet-accessible applications.
On 22 August 2023, the FBI warned cryptocurrency companies of a possible USD 40 million transfer of cryptocurrencies by North Korean TraderTraitor-affiliated actors, also known as Lazarus, which are linked to cyberattacks on cryptocurrency companies. In the same warning, the FBI also attributed the cyber incident on cryptocurrency companies Alphapo, CoinsPaid and AtomicWallet to the Lazarus hacking group.",2023-07-22,2023-07-22,"Attack conducted by non-state group / non-state actor with political goals (religious, ethnic, etc. groups) / undefined actor with political goals; Attack on critical infrastructure target(s)","Attack conducted by a state-affiliated group (includes state-sanctioned, state-supported, state-controlled but officially non-state actors) (“cyber-proxies”) / a group that is generally attributed as state-affiliated ; ",Incident disclosed by victim,Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse,CoinsPaid,Estonia,EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); NORTHEU,Critical infrastructure,Finance,"Lazarus Group/Labyrinth Chollima/HIDDEN COBRA/Guardians of Peace/Diamond Sleet fka ZINC/NICKEL ACADEMY/NewRomanic Cyber Army Team/Whois Hacking Team/Appleworm/Group 77/G0032 (Reconnaissance General Bureau, Bureau 121, Unit 180, Lab 110)","Korea, Democratic People's Republic of","Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested","Non-state-group, state-affiliation suggested (widely held view for the attributed initiator (group), but not invoked in this case)",1,21270,2023-08-22 00:00:00,"Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites)",Attribution by third-party,Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),Not available,United States,"Lazarus Group/Labyrinth Chollima/HIDDEN COBRA/Guardians of Peace/Diamond Sleet fka ZINC/NICKEL ACADEMY/NewRomanic Cyber Army Team/Whois Hacking Team/Appleworm/Group 77/G0032 (Reconnaissance General Bureau, Bureau 121, Unit 180, Lab 110)","Korea, Democratic People's Republic of","Non-state actor, state-affiliation suggested",https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-identifies-cryptocurrency-funds-stolen-by-dprk,Unknown,Unknown,,Unknown,,1,2023-08-22 00:00:00,State Actors: Preventive measures,Awareness raising,United States,Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI),No,,Exploit Public-Facing Application; Trusted Relationship,Data Manipulation,Not available,TRUE,Not available,none,none,"Local effects, e.g., affecting only one restricted area of a country or region (incident scores 1 point in intensity)",Short duration (< 24h; incident scores 1 point in intensity),2,Moderate - high political importance,2,Low,9,Days (< 7 days),No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,1-10,1,1-10,1,> 10 Mio - 100 Mio,37300000,dollar,Indirect (knowingly sanctioning / ordering / ideological / material support by official members of state entities/agencies/units for officially non-state-actors),Human rights; Sovereignty,"Economic, social and cultural rights; ",Not available,1,2023-07-25 00:00:00,"Other legal measures on national level (e.g. law enforcement investigations, arrests)",,Estonia,Estonian Police and Border Guard Board/Politsei- ja Piirivalveamet,Not available,,Countermeasures under international law justified (state-atttribution & breach of international law),,https://www.hackread.com/north-korea-lazarus-group-coinspaid-crypto-heist/; https://securityaffairs.com/148955/breaking-news/security-affairs-newsletter-round-430-by-pierluigi-paganini-international-edition.html; https://securityaffairs.com/148895/cyber-crime/coinspaid-cyber-heist.html; https://coinspaid.com/tpost/0zx28tmj51-coinspaid-is-back-to-processing-after-be; https://coinspaid.com/tpost/7t4xtbgyl1-hack-details-revealed-immediate-reaction; https://thehackernews.com/2023/07/starkmule-targets-koreans-with-us.html; https://research.checkpoint.com/2023/31st-july-threat-intelligence-report/; https://socradar.io/major-cyberattacks-in-review-july-2023/; https://securityaffairs.com/149798/hacking/north-korea-cash-out-stolen-crypto-assets.html; https://therecord.media/north-korea-lazarus-behind-crypto-heists; https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/fbi-identifies-cryptocurrency-funds-stolen-by-dprk; https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/crypto-casino-stakecom-loses-41-million-to-hot-wallet-hackers/; https://securityaffairs.com/150957/apt/lazarus-stole-240m-crypto-assets.html; https://securityaffairs.com/151433/hacking/mixin-network-200m-cyber-heist.html; https://securityaffairs.com/152106/apt/north-korea-laundered-900-million.html; https://therecord.media/poloniex-cryptocurrency-platform-millions-stolen; https://www.techrepublic.com/article/sekoia-financial-sector-evolutions-threats/; https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/us-seizes-sinbad-crypto-mixer-used-by-north-korean-lazarus-hackers/; https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/north-koreas-state-hackers-stole-3-billion-in-crypto-since-2017/; https://therecord.media/cybercriminals-stole-over-1-billion-from-crypto-funds-2023; https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/japan-warns-of-malicious-pypi-packages-created-by-north-korean-hackers/; https://therecord.media/north-korea-cryptocurrency-hacks-un-experts,2023-07-31,2024-09-18,Sent to database

2437,Unknown actor gained access to Zimbra and Roundcube email servers of private and public institutions targeting government entities of different countries beginning in January 2023,"An unknown actor gained access to Zimbra and Roundcube email servers of private and public institutions targeting government entities of different countries beginning in January 2023, the Dutch IT security company EclecticIQ reported on 17 July 2023.
The targeting of government institutions in particular focused on Ukraine, Spain, Indonesia, Brazil, France, and Mexico. Whether the unidentified threat actor managed to break into the email servers of these government organizations was unclear.
EclecticIQ assesses the threat actor exploited vulnerabilities in the Roundcube email servers (CVE-2020-35730; CVE-2020-12641) to distribute phishing messages. Based on a low-confidence judgment, the hackers may also have taken advantage of a zero-day vulnerability in the Zimbra Collaboration Suite version 8.8.15 (CVE-2023-34192) disclosed on 13 July 2023 to circulate phishing lures.
At least one of the phishing messages contained a reply-to email address associated with a Russian hacker forum and likely directly controlled by the attackers. 
This may have been a precaution to prevent any responses to the message to be delivered to hijacked email accounts. The technical report also left open the possibility that the threat actor only had partial access to the email server, allowing them to send emails but not to access associated inboxes.",2023-01-01,Not available,"Attack on (inter alia) political target(s), not politicized; Attack on critical infrastructure target(s)",,Incident disclosed by IT-security company,Hijacking without Misuse,Social Insurance Fund - Lviv Danylo Halytskyi International Airport (LWO) - State Production and Consumer Service - State Audit Service of Ukraine (SAS) - Secretariat of Economic and Port Development - State Border Guard Service of Ukraine - Ministry of Industry (Indonesia) - National Police of Ukraine (NPU) - National Human Rights Commission - City Council of Santa Pau - State University of Intellectual Technologies and Communications - University of Tours,Ukraine; Ukraine; Ukraine; Ukraine; Brazil; Ukraine; Indonesia; Ukraine; Mexico; Spain; Ukraine; France,EUROPE; EASTEU - EUROPE; EASTEU - EUROPE; EASTEU - EUROPE; EASTEU - SOUTHAM - EUROPE; EASTEU - ASIA; SCS; SEA - EUROPE; EASTEU -  - EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS) - EUROPE; EASTEU - EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); WESTEU,State institutions / political system - Critical infrastructure - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system - State institutions / political system; Education - State institutions / political system; Critical infrastructure; Education,Civil service / administration - Transportation - Civil service / administration - Civil service / administration - Civil service / administration - Military - Government / ministries - Police - Civil service / administration - Civil service / administration - Civil service / administration;  - Civil service / administration; Research; ,Not available,Not available,Not available,,1,14442,NaT,Not available,Not available,Not available,Not available,Not available,Not available,Not available,Not available,,Unknown,Unknown,,Unknown,,0,,Not available,,Not available,Not available,Yes,One,Exploit Public-Facing Application,Not available,Required,FALSE,Not available,Not available,"Hijacking, not used - empowerment (incident scores 1 point in intensity)",none,none,1,Moderate - high political importance,1,Low,6,No system interference/disruption,No data breach/exfiltration or data corruption (deletion/altering) and/or leaking of data,11-50,12,,0,,0,euro,Not available,Human rights; Sovereignty,Civic / political rights; ,Not available,0,,Not available,,Not available,Not available,Not available,,Unfriendly acts/retorsions justified (missing state-attribution & breach ofinternational law OR state-attribution & missing breach of international law),,https://blog.eclecticiq.com/spearphishing-campaign-targets-zimbra-webmail-portals-of-government-organizations?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email; https://securityaffairs.com/159273/breaking-news/security-affairs-newsletter-round-459-by-pierluigi-paganini-international-edition.html,2023-07-19,2024-02-19,Sent to database

2402,Unknown foreign government spies targeted British government in June 2003,"In June 2003, the UK government detected an intrusion by an unnamed state actor, the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) disclosed on 30 June 2023, at the 20th anniversary of the incident. The compromise was initiated by a phishing email that led to the discovery of a piece of malware designed to steal sensitive data while avoiding detection by anti-virus solutions. 
In response to the incident, GCHQ for the first time deployed its signal intelligence capabilities under its cybersecurity responsibility to identify the threat actor. Communications-Electronics Security Group (CESG), which was absorbed into the NCSC when the agency was established in 2016, led the investigation as the information assurance arm of GCHQ at the time. CESG identified the activity as focused on espionage and traced the efforts to an undisclosed nation state. The NCSC did not reveal further details about the operation or whether the threat actor succeeded in obtaining any data.

2388,Russian state hackers from APT28 gained access to a single-digit number of email inboxes of board members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in January 2023 in the context of a campaign against multiple EU member states,"Russian hackers gained access to a single-digit number of email inboxes of board members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in January 2023. 
The Russian hackers reportedly exploited a vulnerability (CVE-2023-23397) in a Microsoft software to compromise systems of the SPD's party headquarters, the Willy Brandt House, in Berlin. Microsoft linked the activity to Russian actors.
A spokeswoman for the SPD said on 26 June that it could not be ruled out that data had been exfiltrated from isolated email inboxes. 
SPD secretary general, Kevin Kühnert, added that ""there was solid evidence that attackers from Russia had carried out the attack."" Linking the motivations for the incident to Russia's war against Ukraine, Kühnert asserted that the party saw itself confirmed in the conviction to ""resolutely oppose Putin's war against international law and his other attacks at all levels.""
On 3 May 2024, German Foreign Minister Anna-Lena Baerbock revealed on a trip to Australia, that the German authorities concluded their investigations with the attribution of the campaign towards the Russian state-sponsored group APT28. She also announced that this would have consequences for Russia, without further clarification. However, it became known later in the day that the Foreign Office had summoned the acting chargé d'affaires of the Russian embassy. In the context of the official attribution, it was also disclosed that German entities from the logistics, defence and aerospace industry were also targeted in the same campaign, but no details emerged if data was also stolen in their case. The same day, also the Czech Foreign Ministry attributed a cyber campaign against unspecified Czech targets, based on the exploitation of the same Microsoft vulnerability as in the case of the German targets, towards APT28. Poland issued a statement as well, referring to the targeting of unnamed Polish entities by APT28 in an even more abstract way. The same day, also UK, US, NATO and the EU condemned the Russian operations and expressed their solidarity with Germany and the Czech Republic. 
On 6 May 2024, the German Federal Foreign Office stated that it had ordered the German ambassador in Moscow, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, back to Berlin for a week for internal consultations, thereby also sending another signal of discontent to Moscow.",2023-01-01,Not available,"Attack on (inter alia) political target(s), politicized",,Incident disclosed by media (without further information on source),Data theft;

2357,Unknown actors infected mobile phones of Belgian police officers and judges with spyware since at least 2022,"Unknown actors have infected the mobile phones of Belgian police officers and judges with spyware since at least 2022, the Belgian public broadcaster RTBF reported on 15 June 2023, based on anonymous sources. 
Details on the number of police officers and judges affected, the type of spyware used and possible motivations were not immediately clear. 
The only person affected who was mentioned with full name is Michel Claise, investigating judge in Brussels. Claise is presiding over proceedings related to the so-called Qatargate case, in which certain officials of the European Parliament, lobbyists, and their families have been accused of being influenced by the governments of Qatar, Morocco, and Mauritania. RTBF also reported that its sources believe that Belgian authorities have been spied on because of their responsibilities in the investigation of Qatargate. RTBF, however, notes that this hypothesis is challenged by infections that predate public reporting on Qatargate in December 2022. Access obtained through the spyware may have allowed the actors behind the operation to gather intelligence on the state of the investigation or to put pressure on the people involved in the investigation through information discovered on their phones.

2353,Suspected Chinese threat actor UNC4841 exploited zero-day vulnerability in Barracuda Email Security Gateway to conduct espionage against victim organisations in at least 16 countries since 10 October 2022,"Victim organisations using the Email Security Gateway offered by the IT security company Barracuda started receiving emails designed to exploit the zero-day vulnerability CVE-2023-2868 starting on 10 October 2022. The malicious acitivity was first detected on 19 May 2023 by Barracuda, which launched an investigation in cooperation with the threat intelligence company Mandiant. The investigation uncovered a large-scale campaign that in many cases had successfully extracted data from infected systems. Among the victims from at least 16 different countries are academic targets in Taiwan and Hong Kong as well as government officials in Southeast Asia. Nearly a third of the victims are from the public sector. Mandiant assessed with high confidence that the campaign by the threat actor UNC4841 was conducted in support of the People's Republic of China. 
Barracuda distributed a patch to close the vulnerability on the day after it was discovered, on May 20. Concerns about threat actors persisting in virtual or hardware ESG appliances subsequently led the company to advise the immediate replacement of compromised appliances, irregardless of whether patches had been applied.
On 29 August 2023, Mandiant published a subsequent technical report with new findings. According to this report, the cyber incident lasted into June 2023, and especially after Barracuda published the given vulnerability in May 2023, UNC4841 attempted to maintain access to certain already compromised environments they deemed most important with additional malware. The additional malware was the SKIPJACK, DEPTHCHARGE and FOXTROT backdoors and the FOXGLOVE launcher. The technical report also provided new information on the exact organisations and regions affected.

2336,North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus potentially responsible for stealing $100 million by compromising cryptocurrency wallet platform Atomic Wallet in June 2023,"The North Korean state-sponsored hacking group Lazarus stole $100 million in cryptocurrency assets by compromising user wallets on the decentralised cryptocurrency wallet service Atomic Wallet in early June 2023. Atomic Wallet supports a wide range of popular cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), and others. The company determined that less than 1% of its monthly active users had been affected by the hack.
Researchers at blockchain analytics firm Elliptic attributed the incident on 6 June 2023 to the Lazarus Group “with a high level of confidence” pointing to similarities in laundering techniques observed in previous attacks associated with Lazarus.
On 22 August 2023, the FBI warned cryptocurrency companies of a possible USD 40 million transfer of cryptocurrencies by North Korean TraderTraitor-affiliated actors, also known as Lazarus, which are linked to cyberattacks on cryptocurrency companies.

The alleged Russian False-Flag Group Anonymous Sudan claimed responsiblity for the attempted disruption on Telegram. The inital demand of a ransom of 3,500 USD for stopping the attack and not leaking allegedly stolen data was later increased to 175,000 USD. Whether the group was actually able to access internal information remains unclear. After sustaining its focus on SAS for nine days, albeit with limited effects on downtime, the group upped its demands again first to three million USD on 31 May and then ten million USD on 2 June. This strand of disruption attempts marks a second wave of attacks by Anonymous Sudan against the Swedish airline's online services within a year, following targeting on 14 February.

The cybersecurity community - including news website Bleeping Computer, IT security company Huntress, UK IT security researcher Kevin Beaumont - were able to say as early as 1 June 2023 that a large number of organisations using MOVEit MFT had been affected and had data stolen from them. Kevin Beaumont even said that in addition to Moveit MFT, Moveit Cloud was also affected by this vulnerability. On 2 June 2023, US IT security firm Mandiant wrote that the threat actor they named UNC4875 was responsible for data theft against a range of industries in India, Canada, the United States and probably other countries. UNC4875 exploited the LEMURLOOT webshell to access the targeted organisations. UNC4875 is also said to have similarities to the FIN11 cyber criminal group, according to the report. 
The University of Rochester reported a data theft on 2 June, followed by Microsoft attributing the incident to the Lace Tempest ransomware group, also known as Storm-0950, on 5 June. The Clop ransomware group claimed responsibility for the attack and revealed specific victims, including the BBC, British Airways, Aer Lingus, and Boots. The Clop group set a ransom deadline for affected organizations to prevent data publication. Nova Scotia Health and the Better Outcomes Registry & Network (BORN) Ontario also suffered data breaches. On 8 June, US corporate investigation firm Kroll discovered that the Clop group had known about the MOVEit vulnerability since July 2021 and had started testing it. In 2023, they automated the exploitation, leading to mass data exfiltration on 27 May. On 9 June, the Illinois Department of Innovation & Technology evicted the hacking group from the Illinois state government network within three hours. The Health Service Executive in Ireland and the Minnesota Department of Education also reported breaches on the same day. Progress Software Corporation, the owner of MOVEit, cooperated with third-party cybersecurity experts to uncover a second vulnerability (CVE-2023-35036) on 9 June. The Minnesota Department of Education revealed that 95,000 students were affected, with data transferred from the Department of Human Services and two school districts being compromised. Ofcom, the British communications regulator, was also impacted. On 15 June, it was reported that Oak Ridge National Laboratory and a Department of Energy contractor were compromised, potentially affecting tens of thousands of employees and contractors. 
Progress Software Corporation discovered a third vulnerability (CVE-2023-35708) on 15 June. The Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles, Oregon Driver & Motor Vehicle Services, and associated Department of Transportation confirmed the theft of personal information of citizens in their respective states. On 27 June, the US Department of Health and Human Services notified Congress of a breach affecting HHS contractors and over 100,000 individuals. Researchers estimate that hackers accessed data from more than 16 million people through MOVEit vulnerabilities by the end of June, with the actual number likely higher. The US government warned of three new vulnerabilities in MOVEit software on 7 July, and Progress Software Corporation had already released a service pack to address them on 6 July. 
On 26 July 2023, the government contractor Maximus filed a notification report with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), reporting that personal information of 8 to 11 million individuals had been accessed. The following day, on 27 July 2023, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers the federal insurance programme Medicare, announced that personal and health information of approximately 645,000 individuals had been stolen in the data breach at government contractor Maximus.
On July 31, 2023, VALIC Retirement Services Company (VRSCO) reported the compromise of Social Security numbers and other confidential information of an estimated 798,000 consumers through its third-party vendor Pension Benefit Information (PBI).
In a breach notification filed with the Office of the Maine Attorney General on 2 August 2023, Serco Inc, an IT service management company contracted by various US and Canadian government organisations, has disclosed a data breach after attackers stole the personal information of over 10,000 individuals from a third-party vendor's MoveIT managed file transfer (MFT) server. The company that fell victim to the attack is called ""CBIZ"" and functions as Serco Inc.'s benefits administration provider.
On 8 August 2023, the Missouri Department of Social Services (DSS) reported in a press release that their software vendor, IBM Consulting, notified them that DSS should assume that certain files from DSS stored by IBM in MOVEit software had been accessed by unauthorised users. Three days later, both the press and the Colorado Department of Health Care Policy & Financing (HCPF) itself reported that personal information and personal health information of HCPF members had also been accessed through IBM.
On 3 October 2023, the US-based Flagstar Bank informed that its customer data had been stolen via its third-party service provider Fiserv, which in turn used MoveIT. On the same day, Sony Interactive Entertainment also informed that personal information was stolen from their MoveIT platform.
The Texas Dow Employees Credit Union (TDECU) with Cyber Attack on 29 May 2023, but it wasn’t discovered until 30 July 2024. Customers were notified on 23 August 2024.The impacted data includes full names in combination with Date of Birth, Social Security Number, Bank / Financial Account Number, Credit / Debit Card Number, Driver's License / Government ID, and Taxpayer Identification Number. TDECU has sent personal notifications to those individuals it suspects might have been affected.
On November 12, a hacker known as Nam3L3ss published nearly 8 million employee records from companies such as Amazon, 3M, HP, and Delta. The exposed data was merely structured and obtained by exploiting the Moveit vulnerability.",2023-05-27,Not available,Attack on critical infrastructure target(s),,Incident disclosed by victim,Data theft;

2123,The 19-year-old hacker Jose Luis Huertas gained access into the Judicial Neutral Point and used it to target other Spanish public institutions since at least November 2022,"The 19-year-old hacker with the pseudonym Alcasec gained access into the Judicial Neutral Point and used it to target other Spanish public institutions since at least November 2022.
The Judicial Neutral Point is a network of services that gives access to the databases of the General Council of the Judiciary (CGPJ). That is why the Spanish Tax Administration Agency (AEAT) was also affected by this cyber incident.  
The aim of the young hacker was to create a database as a consultation service and sales point for illegal information. In this cyber incident, the hacker stole data of 575,000 taxpayers, which included personally identifiable information (PII), account and bank number and more. 
The Spanish National Police, in collaboration with the National Cryptology Centre, then arrested the 19-year-old criminal and handed him over to the National Court on 3 April 2023.

2112,"Alleged Russian false-flag operation ""Anonymous Sudan"" stole data from French airline Air France in March 2023","Alleged Russian false-flag hacktivist group Anonymous Sudan stole and published data from French airline Air France in March 2023, the hackers announced themselves via Telegram on 19 March 2023.
The hacktivist group also announced on the same day that it had targeted a number of other French airlines because of cartoons about the Prophet Muhammad. 
On 30 March 2023, Trustwave published a technical report on Anonymous Sudan and concluded that it was a subgroup of the pro-Russian hacktivist group Killnet. In the case of Air France, Trustwave pointed to additional financial motivations, in departure from previous operations by the group, noting that they demanded $3,000 in exchange for deleting the stolen data.

2108,North Korean state-sponsored hacking group LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA trojanized voice and video conferencing software 3CXDesktopApp in March 2023,"North Korean state-sponsored hacking group LABYRINTH CHOLLIMA, an alleged subgroup of Lazarus, trojanized the voice and video conferencing software 3CXDesktopApp starting on 8 March 2023 at the earlierst, US IT security firm CrowdStrike assessed in a 29 March technical report.
CrowdStrike's assessment was subsequently joined attribution statements from Symantec, Sophos, and Huntress with additional reports from SentinelOne, Palo Alto and CheckPoint Research publishing corroborating analysis of the incident without specifying any state links. SentinelOne named the cyber incident Smooth Operator. 
The suspected goal of the operation was to compromise customers using the 3CXDesktopApp in a supply chain attack. Infected 3CXDesktopApp installer and automated malicious updates contained the ability to deploy a backdoor that then sought to connect to the command-and-control (C2) servers used by the threat actors. In a following phase, an infostealer was installed to select customers of interest for follow-on exploitation. The 3CXDesktopApp is a globally used software with customers across various industries, including the automotive industry, food industry, manufacturing, managed service providers (MSP) and hospitality. Specific victims and details about the impact of the operation have not been disclosed as part of the public reports. 
The IT security community found that the hackers exploited a 10-year-old Windows vulnerability (CVE-2013-3900) to make it appear that legitimate software that had actually been tampered was still legitimate. The scary thing is that the fix for this that was provided at the time, which has to be set manually, is not available anymore if the operating system is upgraded to Windows 11.
The Russian IT security company Kaspersky then identified the backdoor Gopuram as the final payload of this cyber operation, in addition to the infostealing malware. For this reason, they attributed this cyber operation to the North Korean state-sponsored hacker group Lazarus with medium to high confidence. Furthermore, Kaspersky announced that less than ten machines were infected with that backdoor, indicating a high level of targeting. Brazil, Germany, Italy and France are said to be the most affected, as well as cryptocurrency companies in particular. In a security update by Mandiant from April 20, the company identified the prior compromise of Trading Technologies X_TRADER software as the initial access vector for the networks of 3CX, making this a case of a ""double supply-chain-attack"". 
On April 21, 2023, IT security firm Symantec added that one company each from the energy sector in Europe and the United States were affected by this cyber incident. In addition, two companies from the financial trading sector were also affected.

1946,Pro-Russian groups Killnet and NoName057(16) targeted Lithuanian company and government websites in June 2022,"According to statements by Killnet itself and a report by IT security company Avast from September 2022, the two pro-Russian groups Killnet and NoName057(16) targeted a Lithuanian company and government websites in June 2022. This is perceived as a direct reaction to Lithuania's decision to ban the transit of goods through their territory to the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad due to EU sanctions. Even if Killnet and NoName057(16) target similar actors and thanked one another for their actions via social media, it is unknown if this specific campaign was a joint undertaking. According to Avast, NoName057(16) directed its malware called Bobik already on 18 June towards Lithuanian transportation companies, local railway, and bus transportation companies. The better known Killnet group claimed responsibility for a wave of DDoS attacks from 27 June onwards, mainly directed against state institutions, transport institutions, and media websites.

1925,Anonymous Sudan disrupted the website of Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and leaked customer information on 14 February 2023,"Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) was hacked and its website taken offline by a group referring to itself as Anonymous Sudan. Customers attempting to log in into the airline's app were redirected and shown information from accounts of other passengers. The incident follows a Quran buring by a far-right politician near the Turkish embassy in Stockholm during a protest in January that was funded by a former contributor to the Russian state-funded outlet RT. Anonymous Sudan has since claimed to have conducted a series of denial-of-service attacks against a variety of organizations in Sweden, citing retaliation for the book burning as its motivation. Targets have included the websites of Swedish airports, banks, railways, airlines, media, telecommunication providers, and organizations in the country's health and education sectors. These alleged attempts do not appear to have caused any significant downtime. 
Anonymous Sudan also took responsibility for knocking Sweden's national broadcaster SVT offline on 14 February, around the same time as the attack against SAS.
Marcus Murray, founder of the Swedish cybersecurity firm Trusec, cautioned Anonymous Sudan may be a front for Russian operators, noting that the Quran burning may be an opportunity for Moscow to instigate tension between Sweden and Turkey to hobble Sweden's bid to join NATO. At least one pro-Russian hacker group, UserSec, had promised Anonymous Sudan support on Telegram.

1834,Dark Pink APT targeted state and corporate organizations in the Asia-Pacific and Europe since mid-2021,"In an eponymous cyber-operation, a newly-discovered APT group named Dark Pink was observed by Group-IB Global to have launched a series of successful malware and spearphishing campaigns against government, military, and corporate entities predominantly based in the Asia-Pacific (APAC) region. Initial attacks date back to at least June 2022, with some indications that the group may have been active as early as May 2021. 
The group likely operates out of the APAC region. Group-IB analysis acknowledges earlier reporting by Chinese cybersecurity researchers at the Anheng Information Shadows Hunting Lab from early January 2023, which tracked overlapping TTPs in a similar target space under the label Saaiwc Group. According to Singapore-headquartered Group-IB Global, which split from its Russia-based parent company in July 2022 to maintain international business accounts in light of sanctions against Russia and the company itself, Dark Pink's objectives are primarily corporate espionage and data theft.
The APT group Dark Pink has been attacking various state and non-state targets in Europe and Asia since February 2022. An update to a report by the cyber security company Group-IB, which for the first time publicly disclosed the new threat actor in January 2023, reveals new details of the sophisticated operations conducted by the group.

1813,Hacker group PLAY carried out a ransomware attack on the Belgian city of Antwerp on 6 December 2022,"The hacker group PLAY carried out a ransomware attack on the Belgian city of Antwerp on 6 December 2022, as first reported by Het Laatste Nieuws. 
The impact and nature of this ransomware attack is still unclear. An initial media report by HLN on the morning of 6 December said that the ransomware attack on 5-6 December crippled a number of municipal services by hacking into servers of IT service provider Digipolis. 
On 6 December, the vice minister-president of the Flemish government and Flemish minister for Living Together and Domestic Administration Bart Somers declared that he ""now wants to release 1.25 million euros for emergency incidents such as these in Antwerp"". 
On 11 December, the hacker group PLAY added the city of Antwerp to its list of victims on its website. They claim to have stolen 557 gigabytes of data, including personal information, passports and more, and announced that they will release this data on 19 December if the ransom demand is not paid. 
The following day, ITdaily reports that data belonging to the city of Antwerp was encrypted, disrupting a number of city services including libraries, museums and schools. 
On 19 December and before, the mayor of Antwerp, Bart de Wever, confirmed at a press conference that about 500 gigabytes of data had been stolen. However, he also says that the disruption to the city of Antwerp was not due to the hacker group, but to the city's security measures. The person in charge of the city of Antwerp even reveals that the stolen data is not personal information, as claimed by the hacker group, but login data and documents related to the city's staff and construction projects.

1779,Cyberattack on Portuguese military resulting in theft and doxing of NATO documents in 2022,"The Armed Forces General Staff agency of Portugal (EMGFA) allegedly suffered a prolonged and undetected cyberattack which resulted in NATO documents being stolen and sold on the dark web. The documents were discovered by American cyber-intelligence agents and notified US authorities at the US Embassy in Lisbon. The National Security Office (GNS) and Portugal’s national cybersecurity center immediately reacted to the threat by deploying a team of experts to EMGFA to investigate the defence agency's network. The stolen documents were acquired through specially programmed bots that probed the network and were trained to discover and detect precisely this type of information. The leak of the documents is of “extreme gravity” and might impact the NATO alliance by creating distrust between members. The EMGFA computers are air-gapped and the data was exfiltrated via standard non-scure lines. This mean that the first assumpt is that the military agency might have ""broken its operational security rules at some point."" No official statement has been released yet by Portuguese officials.

The co-chairman of the hospital's supervisory board Richard Delepierre said on Monday that a ransom demand had been received but that the board had no intention of responding to it. 
France's Minister of Health, Francois Braun, announced that six patients had to be transferred because computer systems have been restricted since Saturday. Three patients had been treated in intensive care. While life-sustaining machines in the intensive care unit remained unaffected, the Center lacked personnel to ensure the monitoring of patients amid organization-wide network outages. As of Monday, the hospital was still only accepting outpatients and had to cancel scheduled surgeries.

It states that it does not ""conclusively attributing the operations to a specific entity, but strong circumstantial evidence suggests a nexus with Spanish authorities"".
The cyber-espionage operation targeted 65 individuals. 52 spyware infections were observed. Among the victims are members of the European Parliament, former Catalan presidents, legislators, jurists, members of the civil society, and also some of their family members. 
The European Parliament launched an inquiry committee to investigate the use of the Pegasus spyware in April, that was already announced in March 2022. This cyber incident is the first time Pegasus spyware was used in Europe. Some of the later reconfirmed victims reported suspected surveillance of their phones as early as 2020.

1659,Russian state-sponsored hacking group IRIDIUM used new Prestige ransomware to attack transport and logistics companies in Ukraine and Poland beginning in March 2022,"Russian state-sponsored hacking group IRIDIUM, which overlaps with the GRU-run group Sandworm, is likely responsible for using the new Prestige ransomware to attack transport and logistics companies in Ukraine and Poland to disrupt Ukrainian military activities beginning in March 2022, according to additional information shared by Microsoft following a technical report on October 14, 2022. Microsoft had previously tracked the activity cluster as DEV-0960.

1599,Pro-Russian group Killnet targets German authorities and ministries with DDoS attacks in early May,"At the beginning of May, the Russian hacker group Killnet attacked servers of several German authorities and ministries via DDoS attacks, making them temporarily inaccessible. The hacker group claimed responsibility for the attack via telegram. The attacks allegedly affected, among others, the Ministry of Defense, the Bundestag, the Federal Police, the Bundeskriminalamt, several state police agencies, airports, and the SPD website of Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Authorities suspect retaliatory attacks over German arms deliveries to Ukraine behind the attacks. The Federal Office for Information Security assesses the attacks as technically unsophisticated.

1577,Pro-Russian group Killnet attacked Romanian websites from the state and private sector in April 2022,"Pro-Russian hacktivists Killnet claimed attacks on government websites in Romania in defense of Russia in the Ukraine-Russian War. The cyber threat actors published a message on Telegram that the attacks followed statements made by Marcel Ciolacu, President of the Romanian Chamber of Deputies, that promised ""maximum assistance"" for the defense of Ukraine and support in providing them with weapons. The Romanian Intelligence Service (SRI) issued a warning that DDoS attacks against Romania had begun on April 29, 2022 at 4:00am. The Romanian national cyber security and incident response team (DNSC) also issued a warning and were investigating the attacks. The attacks specifically targeted web apps (OSI level 7) and almost 300 websites, among them were: gov.ro (official website of Romania's Government); mapn.ro (official website of Romania's Ministry of Defense); politiadefrontiera.ro (official of Romanian Border Police); cfrcalatori.ro (official website of Romania's National Railway Transport Company); and otpbank.ro (site of a commercial bank operating in Romanian). Additional websites were the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Internal Affairs, tax collection agency (ANAF), the Romanian Gendarmerie, and special telecommunications services STS. ""According to the initial statements of the National Directorate of Cyber ​​Security (DNSC), 'the main objective of the attackers is the inactivation of websites and web services, the destruction of reputation and the panic of users in Romania.'"" However, by May 1, 2022, the attack methods had diversified, including ransomware, spearphishing, and spoofing, and were being used to attack the same systems that were targeted in the previous DDoS attacks. The attacks, which used network equipment outside of Romania, caused several hours of disruption to the websites. The DNSC shared indicators of compromise for these attacks and published guidelines to mitigate them.

The attack aimed to destroy over 300 systems in government, IT, energy, and finance sectors. The malware was detected on February 23, 2022, but the attackers had likely gained access to the network as early as December 2021. The specific access vector remains unclear, but the attackers used various methods, including exploiting Microsoft Exchange Server and SQL Server vulnerabilities. The HermeticWiper malware corrupted data, disabled backup services, and rendered targeted computer systems inoperable, impacting Ukraine, Lithuania, and Latvia. The attack was likely related to the escalating conflict in Ukraine, with the goal of crippling local IT systems and hindering the government's response capabilities.

1514,Viasat Hack: Russian Military Intelligence disrupted Ukrainian satellite broadband services in February 2022,"Russia disrupted the satellite broadband services of US communication company Viasat in Ukraine in support of the Russian invasion on 24 February 2022, according to the US State Department, the government of the United Kingdom, and the Council of the European Union. In addition to Ukraine, the disruption of satellite services of Viasat also affected other countries in Europe, including Germany (e.g., German wind turbines). While the Viasat network was ""stabilized"" by 15 March, an incident report was issued by Viasat on 30 March and stated that the company and its customers were still affected by the attack. The US authorities (CISA and FBI) issued a warning on 17 March to US critical infrastructure companies of satellite communications (SATCOM) risks and ""possible threats."" By 10 May the malicious attack was attributed to the Russian Federation. Sentinel Labs identified that the data wiping malware supposedly used in the Viasat attack was AcidRain, the cybersecurity researchers also attributed the malware to being developed by Russian intelligence agencies. The virus was uploaded to VirusTotal via Italy under the file name ""Ukrop."" The malware affected 5,600 wind turbines in Germany that utilized Viasat modems.",2022-02-24,2022-03-15,"Attack conducted by nation state (generic “state-attribution” or direct attribution towards specific state-entities, e.g., intelligence agencies); Attack on non-political target(s), politicized",,Incident disclosed by media (without further information on source),Disruption; Hijacking with Misuse,None - None - None - None - None - None - None,Poland; Hungary; Greece; Ukraine; Germany; Italy; France,EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); EASTEU - EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); EASTEU - EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); BALKANS - EUROPE; EASTEU - EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); WESTEU - EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS) - EUROPE; NATO; EU(MS); WESTEU,Critical infrastructure - Critical infrastructure - Critical infrastructure - Critical infrastructure - Critical infrastructure - Critical infrastructure - Critical infrastructure,Telecommunications - Telecommunications - Telecommunications - Telecommunications - Telecommunications - Telecommunications - Telecommunications,,Russia,State,,8,12406; 12401; 12404; 12402; 12403; 12400; 12405; 12399,2022-07-19 00:00:00; 2022-05-10 00:00:00; 2022-05-10 00:00:00; 2022-05-10 00:00:00; 2022-05-10 00:00:00; 2022-05-10 00:00:00; 2022-05-10 00:00:00; 2022-05-10 00:00:00,"Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites); Political statement / report (e.g., on government / state agency websites)",Attribution by EU institution/agency; Attribution by EU institution/agency; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by third-party; Attribution by third-party,"High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR/VP); High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy (HR/VP); Antony J.

578,Chinese hacking group APT suspected of MSP Theft Campaign Operation Cloud Hopper between 2014-2018,"The Chinese hacking group APT 10 is believed to be responsible for the 2014-2018 cyber espionage campaign Operation Cloud Hopper, which affected management service providers (MSPs) and MSP customers worldwide. The targeted MSPs, including IBM and Hewlett Packard Enterprise, that managed the victims' application, network and system infrastructure were compromised in order to infiltrate the MSPs' customers. The affected companies operate in the technology, industrial manufacturing, retail, energy, pharmaceutical and telecoms sectors. The attack also hit government agencies, including the US Navy and NASA. The attack was technically skilful. In 2018, the US Department of Justice issued an arrest warrant for two Chinese nationals and publicly attributed the attack to APT 10 aka MenuPass, POTASSIUM, Stone Panda, Red Apollo or CVNX. The Five Eyes, Japan and Germany publicly endorsed this attribution. In October 2020, the EU imposed sanctions against two Chinese citizens and the company Huaying Haitai, which were held responsible for the ""Cloud Hopper"" operation. In July 2020, the Council of the European Union decided to sanction Chinese nationals Gao Qiang and Zhang Shilong and the Chinse company Huaying Haitai for the Operation Cloud Hopper within the framework of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox.

712,Russian hacker group APT 28 suspected of hacking into the German Bundestag system in May 2015,"The Russian hacker group ATP 28 aka Fancybear, which is linked to the Russian military intelligence service GRU, hacked into the German Bundestag system in May 2015 and captured gigabytes of sensitive data. It is suspected that the attackers gained access to the system via a phishing email that they sent to employees of the ""Die Linke"" party in the Bundestag. The link in the email led to a compromised website that installed malware on the system. With the help of the malware, the attackers later managed to gain access to the administrator rights of the Bundestag's Microsoft environment. Around 50 IT systems were affected, including the server of then Chancellor Angela Merkel's office. Shortly after the hack was discovered, ""Die Linke"" (the left-wing party) asked cyber security officer Claudio Guarnieri to investigate the cyber incident. In his technical report from June 2015, he attributed the attack to the Russian hacker group ATP 28 alias Fancybear. In the same year, the President of the Federal Intelligence Service declared that a foreign intelligence service was allegedly behind the cyberattack. In May 2016, he publicly attributed the Bundestag hack to Russia. In 2020, the German Federal Public Prosecutor's Office issued an arrest warrant for one of the suspected Russian attackers. In October 22 2020, the Council of the European Union sanctioned, within the framework of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Toolbox, a Main Spe­cial Services Centre of the Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GU/GRU) and its military intelligence officers Dmitry Badin and Igor Kostyukov for the attack.",2015-04-13,2015-05-20,"Attack conducted by nation state (generic “state-attribution” or direct attribution towards specific state-entities, e.g., intelligence agencies);

These emails, believed to be leaked by Russian security services, originated from a small web server in Tomsk, Siberia, and implicated the Climatic Research Unit (CRU) and its director, Professor Phil Jones, in manipulating climate change data. The incident involved hackers breaching the CRU server at the University of East Anglia, copying and distributing thousands of emails and files. Although climate change denialists claimed a scientific conspiracy, subsequent investigations found no evidence of fraud or misconduct. The mainstream media covered the story, and experts affirmed the unchanged scientific consensus on human-caused global warming.

1254,Russian APT29 targeted entities worldwide during the supply-chain cyber espionage campaign Solarwinds starting in 2019,"The Russian government-linked hacking group ""Cozy Bear"" (aka APT29/The Dukes) and an unknown Hacker/ hacking group used the SolarWinds Supply Chain vulnerability to compromise multiple targets worldwide. Mandiant confirmed attribution statements made by the US government that the activity of the UNC2452 (aka Dark Halo) hacking group in the Solarwinds attack was conducted by the Russian-based espionage group, APT29.

The Russian threat actors behind the SolarWinds attack appear to deploy a Nobelium infrastructure, which the Recorded Future Insikt Group calls SOLARDEFLECTION, and ""encompasses command and control (C2) infrastructure."" The Insikt Group issued a report on Nobelium in May 2022 that notes that they have ""made extensive use of typosquat domains in SSL certificates and will likely continue to use deceptive techniques, including typosquat redirection, when using Cobalt Strike tooling.""

In January 2021, investors in SolarWinds sued the company, alleging that they had been misled by SolarWinds before the attack regarding security measures that the company had in place; on 28 October 2022, SolarWinds reached a settlement deal with the investors, agreeing to pay out over $26 million in the wake of the attack. The same day, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned the company that it may face further investigation and punishments. This investigation was regarding potential violations of laws surrounding the disclosure of cyberattacks. On 30 October 2023, the investigation was concluded and resulted in charges against both SolarWinds itself and its Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), with the SEC filing stating that they violated two securities laws by ""overstating its cybersecurity practices and understating or failing to disclose known risks,"" alleging that SolarWinds knew of potential security risks and deficiencies but misled investors through only stating broad, ""hypothetical"" risks.",2019-09-01,Not available,"Attack conducted by nation state (generic “state-attribution” or direct attribution towards specific state-entities, e.g., intelligence agencies);

In June 2015, an official spokesperson for the Paris prosecutor's office stated that the attack was likely linked to the Russian hacking group APT 28, which used the Islamic State's embassies to disguise its attack.

1016,"North Korean State-Sponsored Hacking Group Lazarus Launched WannaCry Ransomware Attack Infecting Over 200,000 Computers in 150 Countries, Including Major Corporations and the UK National Health Service in May 2017","The WannaCry ransomware attack that broke out in May 2017 ranks as a major global ransomware incident. The attack affected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries and impacted companies such as FedEx, Honda, Nissan, and the UK National Health Service. WannaCry is a ransomware that targets Windows operating systems that have not been patched with a specific update offered by Microsoft since March 2017 and encrypts certain user files on the computer. Utilizing the EternalBlue exploit, the ransomware was able to spread rapidly by infecting other vulnerable systems on the same network. The ransomware initially set a ransom of 300 USD (in Bitcoin) and was later increased to 600 USD. Some victims only had a few days to respond to the ransomware demand - otherwise, they risked losing their data. The security authorities subsequently attributed the attack to the Lazarus Group, which is linked to North Korea, although some researchers dispute this attribution. The spread of the attack was inadvertently stopped when a security researcher registered a domain found in the malware's code. Once inside a system, WannaCry employed asymmetric encryption, using a combination of RSA and AES encryption algorithms to lock files, which made the decryption key unique and almost impossible to reproduce without paying the ransom. In 2018, the US brought charges against a North Korean agent of APT Lazarus, who was also previously blamed for the Sony hack in 2014. The extensive damage caused by WannaCry, with an estimated global cost in the billions, was particularly severe for organizations like the UK’s National Health Service (NHS), which suffered an estimated loss of US$100 million due to a large number of vulnerable machines. The discovery of a ""kill switch"" within the WannaCry code eventually stopped the 2017 outbreak from spreading further, although modified versions of the ransomware have since surfaced but failed to reach the same scale or notoriety as the original. On July 30 2020, the Council of the European Union santioned, within the framework of the EU Cyber Diplomacy Tollbox, the North Korean company Chosun Expo for the WannaCry attack",2017-05-01,2024-11-19,"Attack conducted by nation state (generic “state-attribution” or direct attribution towards specific state-entities, e.g., intelligence agencies);

1084,Saudi-Arabia hacks the phones of its critics,"Omar Abdulaziz is a Canadian permanent resident and vocal critic of the Saudi government.
